# First_Data_Analysis_Attempt_-Titanic-
Hello Guys :)

This is an introducary tutorial on Data Analysis with some heavy documenation included to increase the benefit.
 I added 2 python programs that predict the number of titanic survivavals.
1- [titanic_second_attempt.py]: To run this file you will need to include the following csv files in the same locationwhere you save your python programs on you desktop, the files are (train.csv, test.csv)
The prediction will be saved in a file called (Titanic_submission1.csv, it shall be generated in case running the file with no errors.
  
2- [online notebook called ""]: this is an online kaggle kernel I created based on Omar Elgarhy Kaggle kernel but with heavy documentation, It includes some heavy analysis for almost every attribute of the titanic dataset.I will provide the link so you can fork it, or whatever you want.

P.S --> read the comments of the Omar Elgarhy original kernel, people are asking some amazing questions. I will pronide a link as well.
